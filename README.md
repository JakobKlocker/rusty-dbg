# `rusty-dbg`: A Minimal x86_64 Linux Debugger in Rust

`rusty-dbg` is a command-line debugger for Linux systems, written entirely in Rust. It provides basic functionality like stepping through instructions, setting breakpoints, inspecting registers and memory, disassembling instructions, and viewing DWARF-based debug info.

### Requirements

- Linux (x86_64)
- Rust (stable)
- `ptrace` permission (usually root or via `cap_sys_ptrace`)

### Build & Run

```bash
cargo build --release
sudo ./target/release/rusty-dbg <pid|path-to-binary>
```

Or just run from source:

```bash
sudo cargo run -- <pid|binary>
```

## Limitations

This is a **work-in-progress** learning project and lacks many advanced features:

- No thread support
- Minimal signal handling
- No shared library breakpoint persistence
- Only works on **x86_64 Linux** ELF binaries
