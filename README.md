This project was meant to get me started with rust, due to heavy dependency on external Librarys I decided to postpone this project for now.

Simple features such as setting, removing and showing all breakpoints is implimented. 
To continue a deeper understanding of the typesystem is needed to be able to use librarys like Gimli to it's full potential.
